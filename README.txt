Greetings IGN,

My name is Keith Colasinski and I want to work with video games. I'm 24 years old and I've been playing games since I was child. My first real video game experience was on my neighbor's Atari 2600 playing Spiderman and Superman. Afterwards, our parents got me and my brother an NES where we played Super Mario Bros./Duckhunt, from there I was hooked. I've been studying Digital Animation and Game Design at Ferris State University for 2 years now. As well for the past two years I've done volunteer work at the GrandLan Gaming Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan; where I've been able to play and study the latest video game releases while I've also being able to observe gamers of all ages. I want to work at IGN because I believe I can learn more about the industry from a day in the real world experience then I would learn from a year in classes. I enjoy challenges when it comes to working with digital animation, programming, art, and design and I'm fast learner to boot. I've included my resume, I look forward to hearing from you IGN.
